# BasicGame
I made my first game with Pygame.
This game is not hard.
You can move the character with the arrow keys.
And when the score goes above 50, the character's size increases to the only upper tier.
The game is over,when the score is 100.
But the game screen won't turn off.
You can move on.
It is a bug.
